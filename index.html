<h2>WEB이란 무엇인가?</h2>
<p>
  The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, is an information system where
  documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators,
  which may be interlinked by hypertext, and are accessible
  over the Internet. The resources of the Web are transferred via the Hypertext Transfer
  Protocol (HTTP), may be accessed by users by a software application called a web browser,
  and are published by a software application called a web server. The World Wide Web is
  not synonymous with the Internet, which pre-dated the Web in some form by over two decades
  and upon which technologies the Web is built.
